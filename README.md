# CSK_Module_MultiIOLinkSMI
This CSK module provides an easy access to IOLink functionality of AppSpace controller.

For further information check out the [documentation](https://raw.githack.com/SICKAppSpaceCodingStarterKit/CSK_Module_MultiIOLinkSMI/main/docu/CSK_Module_MultiIOLinkSMI.html) in the folder "docu".

## How to Run
Before setting up communication with IO-Link sensor, the sensor port must be powered using [CSK_Module_PowerManager](https://github.com/SICKAppSpaceCodingStarterKit/CSK_Module_PowerManager).
The app includes an intuitive GUI to setup communication with IOLink device.

### Communuication setup

1. After powering the used port, select it in UI
2. Activate the port
3. If there is an IO-Link device connected to activated port, you will see all available information about its identification
4. You can send and receive values to/from device as decimal byte arrays for testing purposes (no IODD needed, see upper part of ReadMessage/WriteMessage UI)

If there is available [IODD interpreter](https://github.com/SICKAppSpaceCodingStarterKit/CSK_Module_IODDInterpreter) with loaded IODD file for the connected device, it is possible to create customized IODD read and write messages:

### Read data

1. Set name for new ReadMessage
2. Create new ReadMessage
3. Select when you want to read data, periodically (period in ms) or on some CROWN event
4. Select process data you want to read from device
5. Select parameters you want to read from device
6. See result of reading the message. You can refresh the latest received payload or initiate reading from UI.

### Write data

1. Set name for new WriteMessage
2. Create new WriteMessage
3. Select process data you want to write to device
4. Select parameters you want to write to device
5. See the latest message written to the device
6. Get the JSON template that must be used for message to be written. When you try to write the message to the device, the message JSON structure must be same as the structure of the template
7. Test writing message to the device by coping and editing the JSON template

## Dependencies

Following CSK modules are mostly necessary to make use of the features of this module:
|Module|Version|Remark|
|--|--|--|
|CSK_Module_PowerManager|[>=V2.5.0](https://github.com/SICKAppSpaceCodingStarterKit/CSK_Module_PowerManager)|To power ports|
|CSK_Module_IODDInterpreter|[>=V2.0.0](https://github.com/SICKAppSpaceCodingStarterKit/CSK_Module_IODDInterpreter)|To set read and write messages|
|CSK_1stModule_Logger|[>=V4.0.0](https://github.com/SICKAppSpaceCodingStarterKit/CSK_1stModule_Logger)|To log problems with data interpretation|
|CSK_Module_PersistentData|[>=V4.0.0](https://github.com/SICKAppSpaceCodingStarterKit/CSK_Module_PersistentData)|To persist data|

## Known issues

### Open Todo
- Data Storage support to save set of all parameters to be applied on controller reboot or device reconnection.

## Information

Tested on  

|Device|Firmware version|Module version|
|--|--|--|
|SIM1012|V2.4.2|V2.0.0|
|SICK AppEngine|V1.7.0|V2.0.0|
|SIM1012|V2.3.0|v1.0.0|

NOTE! Writing process data to IO-Link device works after SIM1012 firmware version 2.3.0

This application / module is part of the SICK AppSpace Coding Starter Kit developing approach.  
It is programmed in an object-oriented way. Some of the modules use kind of "classes" in Lua to make it possible to reuse code / classes in other projects.  
In general, it is not neccessary to code this way, but the architecture of this app can serve as a sample to be used especially for bigger projects and to make it easier to share code.  
Please check the [documentation](https://github.com/SICKAppSpaceCodingStarterKit/.github/blob/main/docu/SICKAppSpaceCodingStarterKit_Documentation.md) of CSK for further information.
